    <h1 class="brown-title">Departmental Goals &amp; Objectives</h1>
    <p class="lead put-me-in-line">
      Our cirriculum revolves around three goals that we consider critical to the field of computer science.<br>By setting these
      goals and objectives, our graduates will be well rounded and prepared for their future careers.
    </p>

  <div class="row">
    <h3 id="goalOne" class="brown-title">Goal One: Discipline Specific Learning</h3>
    <p class="lead put-me-in-line">
      Students will be able to understand and apply the theoretical tools of computer science to standard problems from the field.
    </p><br>
    <h4 class="brown-title">Objectives:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Students will learn core concepts of the discipline as determined by a nationally recognized professional computer science education organization.</li>
      <li>Students will understand and analyze algorithms written in pseudo-code.</li>
      <li>Students will apply the techniques of asymptotic analysis to blocks of pseudo-code and to program fragments.</li>
      <li>Students will describe the design principles used in the construction of particular software systems.</li>
      <li>Students will identify the various components of a computer-based system and explain how they integrate to form a coherent solution.<br>
      Students will document the components in a style commonly used by software professionals.</li>
      <li>Students will develop software solutions in at least three different application areas, such as database systems, user interfaces, graphics,
      <br> computer networks, operating systems, robotics, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h3 id="goalTwo" class="brown-title">Goal Two: Reasoning and Inquiry Skills</h3>
    <p class="lead put-me-in-line">Students will be able to read, write, and analyze program fragments and complete programs.</p><br>
    <h4 class="brown-title">Objectives:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Students will write complete programs to solve small problems typical of the field.</li>
      <li>Students will enhance existing (larger) programs to add capabilities and/or improve the quality of code.</li>
      <li>Students will design test suites for and run debugging sessions on programs they have written as well as on programs written by others.</li>
      <li>Students will complete at least one project using a significant technology in the discipline without direct instruction.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h3 id="goalThree" class="brown-title">Goal Three: Communication Skills</h3>
    <p class="lead put-me-in-line">
      Students will be able gather requirements for a system from third parties, choose a paradigm in which to design the solution, and communicate<br>the parameters of that solution to both professionals in the field and the originating parties.
    </p><br>
    <h4 class="brown-title">Objectives:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Students will develop solutions in response to requirements from persons outside of the department.</li>
      <li>Students will simulate the process of software design as it would be carried out within a professional company.  </li>
      <li>Students will read and criticize reports describing solutions implemented by extramural parties.</li>
      <li>Students will be given the opportunity to present results of their work in oral and written forms; this will include<br>
      the presentation of posters and/or papers intramurally and extramurally.</li>
    </ol>
