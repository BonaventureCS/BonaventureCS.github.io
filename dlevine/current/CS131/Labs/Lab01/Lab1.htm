<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">Due:</span></b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>
Friday, January 17, 4 p.m.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Objective:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This lab introduces Windows 7 and the Eclipse development environment.&nbsp; You will run and 
modify three Java programs and learn how to print program source code and the 
output from a program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Students are encouraged to work in pairs in the lab for this course.&nbsp; However 
this first week each student is expected to complete the lab on his/her own and 
turn it in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
Background:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Windows </b> 7 is the operating system for the PC’s 
that we will use in the Software Development Laboratories (Walsh 101 and Walsh 
103).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will use the <b>Documents</b> folder within your user 
folder on the lab machines to store all your work. Your user folder is 
accessible from any machine in this lab or in the Walsh 103 lab.&nbsp; The 
organization principle you use to create subdirectories within your Documents 
folder is a matter of taste. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 
common practice when programming in Java to create a <b>project</b> for each 
program such as a lab assignment.&nbsp; A project is the collection of files 
used to build the application program. The development environment Eclipse will 
create a new folder for each 
project you create this semester. You will create a project named <b>Lab1</b> 
for today's lab. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To 
retrieve a file from a subdirectory, you must know how to navigate the file 
system (the hierarchy of folders/subdirectories) of the disk.&nbsp; You will learn 
how to navigate the file system in the lab exercises. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Files 
are named with two parts.&nbsp; The first part is the name and the second part 
is called the extension.&nbsp; The two parts are separated by a period.&nbsp; The 
extension identifies the type of file it is.&nbsp; Usually the extension identifies 
the application program that uses the file.&nbsp; For example, you will use a file in 
the exercises of this lab named <font face="monospace">Hello.java</font>.&nbsp; 
The <font face="monospace">.java</font> 
extension indicates that it is a file containing a program written in the Java 
language. Note: if file name extensions are not visible, you can set the view 
options on Windows Explorer to display them. We illustrate this below.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">
Logging onto a lab computer:</span></b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You 
should already have a valid <b>user name</b> for the Computer Science’s domain, 
COMPSCI, on the university’s network.&nbsp; (Note that we set up 
the user names based upon the rosters that are several days old; if you added 
the course recently, you may not yet have a user name.)&nbsp; Your <b>user name</b> 
consists of your first initial and last name preceded by the domain name.&nbsp; 
For example:
COMPSCI\jdoe Your initial <b>password</b> is your student id number 
(6 digits without the leading 0).&nbsp; After you log in the first time, you will be asked to 
change your password.&nbsp; Please choose a non-obvious password for your use.&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: 
in the lab, you can usually log in without the &quot;COMPSCI\&quot; in front of your name.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: 
The <b>user name</b> and <b>password</b> for the Computer Science domain is 
independent of the <b>user name</b> and <b>password</b> you were assigned by 
Technology Services for use on the campus network.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may choose to use the 
same password or you may choose to use different passwords on these different 
domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Instructions:</span></b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>When you sit 
down at a machine in the lab you will need to press the <b>Ctrl-Alt-Delete</b> 
key combination to begin. You must have a valid Computer Science user name to login.&nbsp; The first 
time you login using your user name the system will ask you to reset your 
password.&nbsp; (Note: A “good” password will consist of at least six characters 
including some non-alphabetic characters and both upper- and lower-case letters 
and will not appear as a word in any dictionary in any language.)&nbsp; You will then 
be asked to confirm the new password by reentering the password.</li><br>
<br>
<li>In Windows 7, <b>Windows Explorer</b> will be used to navigate the file system.&nbsp; It can be used to launch applications, copy, move, and 
delete files, and view the directory structure of a disk.&nbsp; You will find an 
icon for Windows Explorer on your task bar (a manila folder icon sitting on the 
task bar along the bottom of the desktop 
window).<br>
<br>
We will use Windows Explorer to create a folder in which to place your work for 
this course and to copy files between the common course folder and your personal 
folder .&nbsp; Throughout the 
semester we will often distribute files that you need for each lab in the <b>CS131</b> 
subfolder of the <b>CSCourses</b> folder.&nbsp; The CSCourses folder is mapped to the 
drive letter <b>K:</b>.&nbsp; (At other times, we will link the files directly 
from the lab web page and you will download them to your computer.) <b> <br>
<br>
</b>When you open Windows Explorer you will see a collection of four Libraries. <br>
<br>
To create the CS131 folder for your work this semester,<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Open <b>Windows Explorer</b> by double-clicking the Windows 
Explorer icon (looks like a manila folder) on the task bar</li>
<li>Click the <b><font face="Times New Roman">&#9658;</font></b> 
next&nbsp; to the icon for <strong>
Computer</strong> (in the left panel)</li>
<li>Click the icon for the drive 
	labeled with our user name (<strong>Z:</strong>)</li>
<li>Right click anywhere in the right pane, select (left click) 
<strong>New</strong> 
from the drop-down menu, then <strong>Folder</strong>&nbsp; (henceforward, select 
<strong>New/Folder</strong>)</li> 
<li>Enter <strong>CS131</strong> for the name of the new folder</li>

</ul>
<br>Now we need to locate the files for this lab in the CSCourses folder.<br><b>


<br></b>To find the files for Lab 1, <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Open <b>Windows Explorer</b> by double-clicking the Windows Explorer icon on the task bar</li>
<li>click the <b><font face="Times New Roman">&#9658;</font></b> next to the icon for 
<b>Computer</b> (in the left panel) </li>
<li>click the <b><font face="Times New Roman">&#9658;</font></b> next to the icon for 
<b>cscourses (K:)</b></li>
<li>click the <b><font face="Times New Roman">&#9658;</font></b> next to the icon for 
<b>CS131</b></li>
<li>click the icon for <b>Lab1</b></li><br> 

</ul>
<br>The files necessary for Lab 1 are in this folder. You need do nothing now - a little later in the lab you 
will copy the files into the folder that Eclipse creates for you.</li><br><br>
<li>Minimize the <b>Windows Explorer</b> window.&nbsp; Launch Eclipse by double-clicking the
<b>Eclipse</b> icon on the desktop.<br><br>You will be asked to select a folder for your workspace. (If you are not, get 
help from the instructor or lab assistant.)&nbsp;
Use the browse button to find the CS131 folder you created in step 2. The path 
would be <strong>Z:\CS131</strong>. Check 
the checkbox that indicates that you wish this folder to be the default workspace folder. A 
workspace is simply a folder in which Eclipse will store files on which you are 
working.<br><br>Within Eclipse, close the Welcome window by clicking on the &quot;X&quot; 
in the upper right corner.&nbsp; Examine the window view that Eclipse provides. Eclipse initially shows four 
panes.&nbsp; I suggest you close (using the <strong>x</strong>) the <strong>
Outline</strong> pane on the right side of the window.&nbsp; We will be most 
interested in the <strong>Package Explorer</strong> pane along the left and the 
unnamed edit pane in the middle of the Eclipse window.&nbsp; The Package Explorer 
gives a view of all of the projects available. At this point there are not yet 
any projects.<p class="Question">Create a new project named <b>Lab1</b>.&nbsp; Go to 
<b>File</b> 
/ <b>New</b> / <b>Java Project</b> and create a new Java project with the name 
<b>Lab1</b>.&nbsp; You will see the <b>Lab1</b> project appear in the <b>Package</b>
<b>Explorer</b> window.&nbsp; Expand the project by clicking the <b>
<font face="Times New Roman">&#9658;</font></b> next to Lab1.&nbsp; You will see a 
folder named <strong>src</strong>.&nbsp; This is where you will store source files, i.e. files 
with <font face="monospace">.java</font> extension.&nbsp; Now we want to put two 
Java files into this project.&nbsp; Re-open <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> and copy the 
file <font face="monospace">HelloWorld.java</font> by right-clicking on the file 
name and selecting <b>Copy</b>.&nbsp; Then return to Eclipse, right-click on <b>src</b> in 
<b>Lab1</b> in the <b>Package</b> <b>Explorer</b> and select <b>Paste</b>.&nbsp; 
Copy the file <font face="monospace">DisplayMessage.java</font> to <b>Lab1</b> 
in the same way.&nbsp; You should see two Java source files 
in the <b>Default Package</b> folder in <b>Lab1 \ src</b>: 
<font face="monospace">HelloWorld.java</font> 
and <font face="monospace">DisplayMessage.java</font>.</li><br><br>
<li>Double-click on the program source file
<span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">HelloWorld.java</span> in the 
src folder.&nbsp; The 
source file is opened in the <b>Edit</b> pane. &nbsp;</li><br>
<br>
<li>To run the program, first click on the source file name (e.g., <b>
<span style="font-family: Courier New">HelloWorld.java</span></b>) in the Package 
Explorer, then go to the Editing pane (where the source code is located), and 
right-click.&nbsp; From the pop-up menu, select <b>Run As</b> followed by <b>Java Application</b>. The program's output will appear in the 
<b>Console</b> pane, which will appear  below the Edit pane.&nbsp; &nbsp;
Alternatively, you can run a program by right-clicking on the file name in the 
Package Explorer and select <b>Run As</b> followed by <b>Java Application</b>.</li><br>
<br>
<li>Modify the program so that it greets you  specifically (as opposed to the entire world).&nbsp; 
Run the program to test your modifications.</li><br>
<br>
<li>Modify the program so that it displays three labeled pieces of 
information each on a separate line as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-mail:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lab meeting:<br>
with the appropriate information supplied.&nbsp; 
<p class="Question">Modify the comments at the top of 
the program to add your name, the date, and a description of your program 
modifications.&nbsp; Run the program to test your modifications.</li><li><p class="Question">
	Minimize Eclipse and open Microsoft Word. [If asked, choose &quot;Don't Make 
	Changes&quot; as your 'update policy'.]&nbsp; Generate a cover page for this lab, which indicates the lab number, date, course name and your name. On the next page 
write a short paragraph responding to each of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">How does Java terminate statements or instructions that 
	are to be executed by the computer?</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">How does Java identify comments?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Question">The rules for writing Java programs, syntax rules, are very strict and generate an error if violated. The Eclipse editor, however, is designed to inform you of a syntax error, as is the Eclipse compiler. Generate a syntax error by removing one of the semi-colons from a line that prints a string. </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Write a paragraph that describes how the editor indicates that there is an error. Record your results (note: use complete sentences that you can read six months later and know what is being discussed. For example, 
	&quot;The Eclipse editor shows that a syntax error has occurred by ... &quot;)
	</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Attempt to run the program with the syntax error. 
	<span class="style2">Describe what happens and how you are assisted in correcting the error</span>. Fix the error and run the program. 
	<span class="style2">What happens?</span>
	<b>Note: </b>you can view the compiler's guess at the cause of a syntax 
	error by using the mouse to hover above the mark used by the editor to 
	indicate the error.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Repeat the syntax experiment by removing ' &quot; ' that 
	terminates the line that displays your name.&nbsp; Run the program. 
	<span class="style2">Record and explain 
	the error message that is generated.</span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Based upon the two experiments with syntax errors, 
	<span class="style2">explain whether or not you found the error messages generated by the editor 
	to be helpful</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
	</li>

<p>
<li>To print a copy of your program go to the <b>File</b> menu and select the
<b>Print</b> option.&nbsp; (If the <strong>Print </strong>option, is grayed out, 
click on the program in the Edit pane.)&nbsp; Find the printer named Lab Laser 101. (If you do not see 
Lab Laser 101 scroll the dialog box window to the left; if you still do not see 
Lab Laser 101, you will need to add that printer.&nbsp; Get help from your instructor 
if you need it for this task.&nbsp; Do not bother to print the test page if 
you are given the opportunity to do so). <span class="style2">A copy of your program will appear on the printer in the 
lab</span>.&nbsp; Note that programs look very similar.&nbsp; It is very important to place your 
name prominently in a comment at the top of the program so that you (and others) 
may identify whose output is whose.</li><br><br>

<li>Now we want to work on the second program.&nbsp; 
Currently when you run the program you are running the program given in the file
<span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">HelloWorld.java</span>.&nbsp; 
There is a second program in the Lab1 project that you need to run named
<span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">DisplayMessage.java</span>.&nbsp; Open the file
<span style="font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">DisplayMessage.java</span> in the editor window by 
double-clicking on the file name 
in the Package Explorer. <br>
<br>
Run this program.&nbsp; You will notice that this program displays a message 
using a dialog box rather than using a console window as previously done.&nbsp; 
Click the <b>OK</b> button to dismiss the dialog box.&nbsp; Also click the 
close box on the full application window.<br>
<br>
<li>Examine the code for the program in the editor and modify the program by changing the 
message that is displayed.&nbsp; In particular, display the same information 
requested in Step 7 above in the dialog box.&nbsp; 
<p class="Question">First modify the program to 
display the messages in a sequence of dialog boxes.&nbsp; Then modify the 
program to display all of the messages in a single dialog box.&nbsp; (Hint: You 
need to use one of the &quot;escape sequences&quot; discussed on pages 63-64 of your 
textbook and illustrated in the program on page 64.) </p>
<p class="Question">Change the opening comments to reflect the modifications you 
made.&nbsp; In particular, add your name, the date, and a description of the 
modifications to the opening comments. <br>
<br>
Note that an <em>object</em>, myWindow, is created in this program. 
Note also that <em>messages</em> are sent to the object such as myWindow.setLocation(), 
myWindow.setSize(). The data inside the parentheses are called <em>arguments</em>. You 
will change the values passed as arguments to the object. Write down all of the 
values that are passed to the myWindow object in the original version of the 
program - you will need to reset them later. Please write a paragraph explaining 
the results of the following changes:
    <br />
    <ul>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Change the values passed to myWindow in the setLocation 
	message (you may need to change them three or four times). 
	<span class="style2">What does this message do? What is the largest x and y coordinate 
	that can be passed that enable myWindow to be completely visible? </span> </p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Place the window in the upper left hand corner of the 
	monitor. Change the values passed in the setSize message.&nbsp; <span class="style2">What is the largest window size that can be set 
	and still have the window completely visible? What happens if the size is 
	set to 0,0?</span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">What does setTitle do? </p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="Question">Comment the line of code with the setVisible message (to 
	comment one line, use the two forward slashes, //, at the beginning of the 
	line). This will c<span class="style3">reate a program in which the 
	visibility is never set explicitly.&nbsp; Run this program.&nbsp; </span>
	<span class="style2">What happens? What is the default value (the value that 
	&quot;naturally&quot; occurs if you don't specify otherwise) of the visibility of a 
	window?</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Question">Reset the various arguments in the messages to their 
original values. Change the opening comments to reflect the modifications you made.&nbsp; In particular, add your name, the date, and a description of the modifications to the opening comments.&nbsp; 
<span class="style2">Print a copy of the modified program</span> and hand this in as part of your lab.</p>
<li>Now copy the program <span class="style1">DisplayMessageGUI.java
</span>from the CSCourses folder as you did before. Add this program to your project&nbsp; 
(see step 3 for a reminder). 
Also copy the file <span class="style1">DrL.jpg</span>.&nbsp; 
Instead of adding this file to the <strong>src</strong> folder, add it to the 
parent project (<strong>Lab1</strong>) folder.&nbsp; Run the program. 
<span class="style2">What do you see?</span>  Explore the menu choices (both of them).  Open the file and look at the source code.
&nbsp; Find the statement that causes the message to be printed.&nbsp; As you did in the previous step, modify the message that is shown so 
that it displays the same information as in Step 7.</li><br>
<br>
<li>Now change the program so that the title bar includes your name and so that the 
About box has the correct info.&nbsp; (For purposes of today's lab, you may 
claim full authorship of the program; we'll talk about proper credit later.)&nbsp; 
Make sure that the picture is relevant as well.&nbsp; (Hint: you have a cell 
phone...)&nbsp; Use the Snipping Tool to take &quot;<a href="../ScreenSnapshots.htm">snipshots</a>&quot; 
of the two modified windows and <span class="style2">include those images with 
your lab</span>.<br>
<br>

Change the opening 
comments to reflect the modifications you made.&nbsp; In particular, add your name, 
the date, and a description of the modifications to the opening comments.&nbsp; 
<span class="style2">Print 
a copy of the modified program</span> and hand this in as part of your lab as well.
</li><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<li>When you have completed the lab you need to properly 
exit the lab machine.&nbsp; Close<b> </b>both Eclipse and Word (after saving 
what you need).&nbsp; <b>Do not turn off the power of the machine or the 
monitor.</b>&nbsp; Simply log off the machine by clicking the <strong>Windows</strong> 
button (in the lower left corner of the screen) and then selecting <b>Log Off</b> from the menu accessed with the 
<font face="Times New Roman"> <b>
&#9658; </b>next to the &quot;Shut Down&quot; command</font>.
