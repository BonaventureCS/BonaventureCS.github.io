      <h3>Homework</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Mon, Mar 3 - There was code on the mobile white board this morning that
        is the cause of some major security problems with the iPhone. What is
        the (logic) error in the code and how would you fix it?<br>Write a compareTo
        method for the <a href="Code%20Examples/Person.java">Person</a> class where
        the comparison is based on the name. Include appropriate Javadoc
        comments.<br>Write a compareTo method for the
        <a href="Code%20Examples/Student.java">Student</a> class where the
        comparison is based on the GPA. Include appropriate Javadoc comments.</li>
        <li>Wed, Feb 19 - Write a program to store a list of 20 random numbers in
        the range 1-100 in an ArrayList (as you did in Lab 6). Then find the
        largest value in the list. Consider a list of 1000 values. What
        is the maximum number of comparisons required to find the largest?
        What is the minimum number of comparisons?</li>
        <li>Wed, Feb 12 - Write an Employee class that extends the Person class.
        Add a field to store salary, write a constructor for the Employee class, add
        a getter for the new field, override the toString() and equals() methods.
        Include proper Javadoc comments with your code.</li>
        <li>Wed, Feb 5 - Modify the <a href="Code%20Examples/Person.java">Person</a>
        class by <em>overriding</em> the toString() and equals() methods and by
        adding a <em>default constructor</em>. Include Javadoc comments with
        your code.</li>
        <li>Mon, Feb 3 - Find a definition of <em>polymorphism</em> as it applies to
        programming. Use the defintion you find in the textbook.</li>
        <li>Wed, Jan 29 - Exercise R-2.13 (p. 94)</li>
        <li>Fri, Jan 24 - Find definitions for <em>abstraction</em>, <em>encapsulation</em>,
        <em>information-hiding</em>, and <em>inheritance</em> as they apply to
        programming. (Use any definitions you find in the textbook.)</li>
        <li>Mon, Jan 13 - Complete the worksheet <a href="Homework/Conversions.pdf">
        &quot;Type Conversions&quot;</a> for Wednesday<br></li>
