due Wednesday, January 15, by 2 p.m.</p><font SIZE="2"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a simple program to &quot;warm you up&quot; and to set up some basis for class discussion.&nbsp; You are to write a Java&nbsp; program that can take an arbitrary number integers as data and then tells how many of the integers are &quot;above average&quot;, i.e. how many of the data are greater than the mean.</p><p>Your program should begin by reading the number of integers from the user (prompts are neither necessary nor desired).&nbsp; If this number is legal (i.e. is non-negative), then that many numbers should be read.&nbsp; If it is not, then an error message should be printed.&nbsp; A sample run is below.&nbsp; User inputs are underlined</p></font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><blockquote><u>4<br>1 2 3 4</u><br>The number of values &gt; average is: 2 </blockquote></font><font SIZE="2"><p>You are to write your program in Java.&nbsp; You may use any standard class you wish.</p><p>You are to print out a listing of your program, along with two sample runs - one that produces output similar to the above (though a more substantial example would be nice) and one that shows your error message in action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are to be stapled together, along with a cover sheet, and are to be turned in to me by 
2 p.m. on 
January 15.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></font>
<p><b>BONUS</b></p><font SIZE="2">
<p>For a <em>small</em> amount of bonus credit, turn in a second version of the program.&nbsp; 
This version does not specify how many numbers are to be read; rather it reads 
as many as it gets on a single line.&nbsp; If you do write this program, make 
sure to turn in both versions.</p></font></body></html>
