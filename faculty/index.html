    <p class="well lead hidden-xs">The strength of Bonaventure's Computer Science Program is its faculty. Each faculty member is first and foremost a dedicated teacher who enjoys the close contact with students afforded by class sizes of 15 to 20 students. All are active in regional and national computer organizations and have published widely in the area of computer science education. Together the computer science faculty has published over 60 articles and five books, participated in twelve National Science Foundation workshops, and written four successful National Science Foundation grant applications. Most have ongoing research programs in which they involve junior and senior majors, and they involve students in Departmental outreach events such as Girl's Day and the High School Programming Contest.</p>
