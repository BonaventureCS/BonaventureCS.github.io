<a name="GridWorld"></a>APCS GridWorld Role Plays</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in 2007-08, the case 
study for the AP curriculum will feature the GridWorld framework.&nbsp; We are 
working on two role playing exercises related to this case study.&nbsp; The 
first is designed to emphasize how the various classes interact.&nbsp; It uses 
only concepts through Chapter 2 of the case study.&nbsp; The second is designed 
to highlight the organization of the Critter class and uses concepts through 
Chapter 4.&nbsp; The scripts for both can be found in the Scripts document.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scripts for the role play are very fluid when first 
written.&nbsp; Based upon early experiences we modify (and hopefully improve) 
the scripts a good deal.&nbsp; When we released the scripts for the Marine 
Biology Simulation four years ago, early (and sometimes incorrect) versions 
seemed to proliferate.&nbsp; Therefore, we are holding off releasing the scripts 
for this role play until about the eighth of August.&nbsp; At that time, the 
documents will be linked from this page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are releasing the documents as PDF files.&nbsp; If, for 
some reason, you need a copy that you can edit, please contact us and we will 
send you an editable version in Microsoft Word format.</p>

<h3>AP Marine Biology Simulation Role Play (Java Version)</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in 2003-04, the AP curriculum will use Java as its delivery language.&nbsp; Accordingly, a new the case study has been written.&nbsp; As was the case when the AP curriculum moved from Pascal to C++, the topic of the case study has been preserved, but the code (and the narrative) have been completely rewritten.&nbsp; We have written a scripted role play exercise that introduces users (actors and observers) to the fundamental aspects of this new case study, including the use of inheritance within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/JavaMBSRolePlayScripts.doc">JavaMBSRolePlayScripts.doc</a>&nbsp; (last updated 7/16/03; thanks to Robb Cutler)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/JavaMBSRolePlayOverview.doc">JavaMBSRolePlayOverview.doc</a>&nbsp; (last updated 7/11/03)</p><p>Note:&nbsp; 7/11/03 update of scripts had bad link.&nbsp; If you downloaded that one, you definitely want to repeat the download now.</p><h3>Marine Biology Case Study Role Play (C++ Version)</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Advanced Placement Computer Science curriculum, students study a large object-oriented program in depth.&nbsp; Currently, that program is the Marine Biology Case Study (MBCS).&nbsp; This program consists of large numbers of interacting objects from seven different classes (plus a separate main function).&nbsp; It is our experience that students (and teachers!) can feel overwhelmed when they first encounter MBCS.&nbsp; We have found that the following scripted role playing exercise can be very helpful in terms of getting a grasp on the program.&nbsp; In addition to being used in our courses (where we used MBCS as long as we used C++), this exercise has been used by large numbers of teachers attending College Board workshops.&nbsp; The current version of both the role play and the overview documents incorporates the feedback of many teachers.&nbsp; We thank you all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/MBCSRolePlayScripts.doc">MBCSRolePlayScripts.doc</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/MBCSRolePlayOverview.doc">MBCSRolePlayOverview.doc</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Chips Role Play</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chips is a Nim-like game in which two (or more) players take turns removing some number of indistinguishable chips from a pile.&nbsp; The initial pile size, N, is a parameter of the game.&nbsp; The first player must remove between 1 and N-1 chips, inclusive.&nbsp; Each subsequent player must remove between 1 and 2*previous_move chips.&nbsp; The player to remove the last chip wins.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have written a version of Chips in which players of various strategies (e.g. random, &quot;always take 1&quot;, &quot;ask the user&quot;) can compete.&nbsp; The various strategic player classes inherit from an abstract player class.&nbsp; (This code is available in both C++ and Java versions.)&nbsp; We have also written role play scripts and an overview document for Chips.&nbsp; Note that the inheritance in this role play is modeled through delegation. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/ChipsRolePlay.doc">ChipsRolePlay.doc</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.sbu.edu/dlevine/RolePlay/ChipsRolePlayOverview.doc">ChipsRolePlayOverview.doc</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Other Role Play Exercises</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &quot;subpage&quot; of <a href="http://cs.colgate.edu/APCS/">Chris Nevison's Unofficial APCS Web page</a> has a number of other role playing exercises.&nbsp; One illustrates parameter passing; one demonstrates some recursion; and a third demonstrates the workings of an elevator control system.&nbsp; (The latter two make some use of graphics.)&nbsp; The index page for his role play exercises is <a href="http://cs.colgate.edu/APCS/Java/RolePlays/JavaRolePlays.htm">here</a>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
