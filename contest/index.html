     <p class="well lead">For the past twenty-five years St. Bonaventure University's Computer Science Department has hosted a programming contest for high school students.  Originally the contest attracted schools in Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Over the years the contest has grown and teams have traveled to Bonaventure from a wider area.  In addition to schools from Buffalo, Rochester, Ithaca, Pittsburgh, and Erie, schools from Ohio, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, and even California have participated.  The contest provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their programming skills in a competitive environment.</p>
