Report on Racket</p></font><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;due 
Wednesday, April 16, by 4 p.m.</p><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p><font SIZE="2"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You are to prepare a report on the 
RacketYour report should consist of a written description as well as a discussion of each of the concepts listed below.&nbsp; In each case, appropriate code examples (either fragments or complete programs) should be included.&nbsp; It is expected that the report will be written as a single coherent document rather than as a list of unconnected answers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concepts you are to cover include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>lambda expressions</li><li>functional forms (both built-in and user-defined)</li><li>recursion</li><li>functions as first-class entities</li><li>
	scoping in Racket</li><li>EVAL vs. QUOTE</li><li>structures for representing data</li></ul><p>Your report should contain more information than is found simply in 
Section 15.5 of the text.&nbsp; (Scheme and Racket are essentially the same for 
purposes of this assignment.)&nbsp; At the very least, it should be organized somewhat differently than that 
material.&nbsp; In particular, you should not feel constrained by the ordering of the list above.&nbsp; Your report should also include 
nine appendices - the first two should contain answers to problems 9 and 10 on pages 
723 and 724 of the text; the next 
six should contain answers to exercises 1,&nbsp; either 2 or 3 (but not both), 4, 6, 9, 
and 14 on pages 724 and 725; the eighth should contain the function Nth as described in the &quot;<a href="racketLab.htm">lab</a>&quot; experience.&nbsp; 
(Note:&nbsp; You should probably finish this lab by April 1 at the latest.) You may reference the solutions to these problems as possible examples for the discussions in the body of the paper, but it is required that you solve them whether or not they are relevant to your discussions.</p><p>This is a &quot;proper&quot; paper.&nbsp; Therefore, it is expected that you will follow all standard writing guidelines; your paper should include proper grammar, spelling, tone, etc.&nbsp; Of utmost importance is that you properly cite ANY material that you reference - including the textbook and any web-based sources.&nbsp; (If you have any doubt whatsoever about the necessity of a citation, put it in; no one will be penalized for too much care in this area.)</p><h4>Important Note</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your solutions to the exercises are to be more than one line long.&nbsp; By this I mean that you are not to implement the function simply by having it call another function that does all of the work.&nbsp; You must implement the algorithm required on your own.&nbsp; (In other words, you must do more than &quot;look up&quot; the answer.)</p></font><h4>Due Date&nbsp;</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> Electronic copies of each of the Scheme functions are due in my email box&nbsp; (at <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
<a href="mailto:dlevine@sbu.edu">dlevine@sbu.edu</a></font>) such that I receive it by 
4 p.m. on Wednesday, April 16, 2014.&nbsp; A hard copy of your report must be in my possession at that time as well.</font></p><p><font size="2"></p><h4>Assignment Type</h4><p>This is an <u>Individual Assignment Without Collaboration </u>as defined in the Department's Academic Policies and Procedures Document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></font></body></html>
