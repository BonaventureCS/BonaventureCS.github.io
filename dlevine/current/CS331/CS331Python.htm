<h2 align="center">CS 331 and Python</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage you to practice coding (usng the CodingBat site), the following 
policy will be used to award credit for CS 331.</p>
<h4>The basic rules</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create a CodingBat account and edit the Preferences so that your name 
	matches the suggestion and you share with &quot;<a href="mailto:dlevine@sbu.edu">dlevine@sbu.edu</a>&quot; 
	as your instructor.</li>
	<li>Solve as many Python problems as you like on the CodingBat site each week.</li>
	<li>When you have solved three problems in a category, you will earn a star 
	for that category.</li>
	<li>Send me an email telling me which three problems you solved.&nbsp; Upon 
	verification that you have earned a star, you will earn one-half bonus point 
	towards your final average.&nbsp; Email messages must be sent before noon on Monday to 
	earn credit for that week.</li>
	<li>Emails for each week should have a subject line that includes the words 
	&quot;PythonBat - Week X&quot; where X is replaced by the week number.&nbsp; September 
	9 is &quot;Week 1&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li><span class="style1"><strong>Problems must be solved individually</strong></span>.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Problems which have solutions at the site (from Sections Warmup-1 or 
	Warmup-2) do not count towards any extra credit.</li>
	<li>You may not &quot;re-solve&quot; any problem to earn credit, but you may solve some 
	&quot;in advance&quot;.&nbsp; (You must sent a separate email for each set 
	of three.)</li>
	<li>At most one stars can be earned in each category over the course of the 
	semester (at least as far as extra credit goes - you can earn all the ones 
	you want for your own benefit).&nbsp; </li>
	<li>You may not use outside resources (such as friends/tutors and/or the 
	Internet) to help you solve the problems.&nbsp; I reserve the right to 
	withhold the credit if I believe that I have evidence that this has 
	happened.&nbsp; I will discuss this with you before doing so.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The &quot;big bonus&quot;</h4>
<ol>
	<li>If you earn a check mark for a problem with a solution that is actually 
	incorrect, i.e. the solution is flawed, but the site did not detect this, 
	you earn a &quot;triple bonus&quot;.&nbsp; (Note: your solution cannot involve 
	hardcoding inputs; it must be a &quot;legitimate&quot; attempt at the problem.)&nbsp; </li>
	<li>If you tell me about it (as opposed to my noticing), you earn a 
	&quot;quintuple bonus&quot; instead.</li>
</ol>
<p class="style2">(This has happened at least three times with Java programs; I 
have personally reported each such incident to Nick and he fixed the test data.&nbsp; But I suspect that 
other cases exist - albeit not in the simplest problems.)</p>
