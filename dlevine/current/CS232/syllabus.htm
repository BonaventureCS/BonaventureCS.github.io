and Goals</p></b></font><p>Computer Science 232 studies the mathematical structures (both algorithms and data structures) that contribute to software efficiency.&nbsp; The course focuses on various well known problems and their various solutions.&nbsp; From these examples, general techniques are drawn out as exemplars of more general problem solving.&nbsp; Students will be expected to master both the mathematical analysis of these solution techniques and to gain experience with their implementations in programs.&nbsp; A mixture of applied and theoretical homework will be assigned. </p><p>CS 232 has several goals.&nbsp; At the end of this course, you should be able to:</p><ul><li>Analyze algorithms for time and space efficiency;</li><li>Write programs using, the greedy, the divide-and-conquer, and the dynamic programming paradigm;</li><li>Create written descriptions of algorithms using pseudo-code.</li></ul>
<p class="style7">In addition to the general goals, this course has the goal of ensuring that students are capable of writing programs entirely on their own, as opposed to as part of a paired environment.&nbsp; The two multi-stage programming assignments aid in the achievement of this goal.<br></p>

<b>
<p>Classroom Etiquette</p></b>

</font>

<p>Use of cell phones or other personal electronic devices during class is rude and 
inconsiderate of others.&nbsp; Please <u>turn off cell phones</u> and 
similar devices during classes and labs.&nbsp; This policy does not apply to 
personal laptops or tablets which may be used for notes and lab exercises.</p>




<b><font SIZE="4"><p>Attendance</p></font></b><p>As mature college students, it is expected that all class members can make reasonable decisions about attending class and what constitutes a legitimate excuse for missing class.&nbsp; Roll will not be taken in class (after the roster has stabilized), but students are cautioned that there will be some material covered in class that is not in the textbook and that missing a class may result in their being inadequately prepared for the homework.</p><p>In ALL cases, if a student misses class, it is the student's responsibility (and not the instructor's) to learn about pending work and to make arrangements for the timely submission of any assignments.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b><font size="4">Services for Students with Disabilities</font></b></p>Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Disability Support Services Office, Doyle Room 26, at 375-2066 as soon as possible to ensure better that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.&nbsp; Documentation from this office is required before accommodations can be made. <br><p><b><font SIZE="4">Grading</p></font></b><p>The final grade will be determined by a combination of&nbsp; items as determined by performance on examinations and on written assignments.&nbsp; The final grade will be determined approximately as follows:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="439"><tr><td WIDTH="361" VALIGN="TOP"><b>Best five (of eight) quizzes</b></td><td WIDTH="38" VALIGN="TOP"><b>25%</b></td></tr><tr><td WIDTH="361" VALIGN="TOP"><b>Final examination</b></td><td WIDTH="38" VALIGN="TOP"><b>25%</b></td></tr><tr><td WIDTH="361" VALIGN="TOP"><b>Homework exercises

Monday May 
	5, at 10:35 a.m. and will be comprehensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><font size="4">
<b>Homework</b></font></p><p>Homework exercises will be assigned regularly and 
will generally be exercises taken from the book.&nbsp; Homework assignments will 
not be weighted equally; rather they will be weighted according to the 
complexity of the assignment, i.e. a nearly trivial assignment will be weighted 
less than a more substantial one.&nbsp; There may be one or more &quot;small&quot; 
programming assignments given out as part of the 'regular' homework; these will 
be short enough that they can easily be completed in a 48-hour time block.</p>

<font SIZE="4"><b><p>Programming Projects</p></b></font>
<p>There will be two programming projects assigned during the semester.&nbsp; 
Each will be assigned far in advance of its due date and will consist of 
multiple &quot;phases&quot; that students may turn in as they complete them.&nbsp; Each 
phase will receive its own grade and these grades will be summed to determine 
the final grade for the programming exercises.&nbsp; The first exercise<em> counts 
twice as much</em> as the second.</p>

Basically, we will be moving through the text in its natural order.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We will skip some of the later sections of many of the chapters and will 
probably omit Chapter 12 in its entirety.&nbsp; Specific reading assignments 
will be given on the class web page and announced in class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
