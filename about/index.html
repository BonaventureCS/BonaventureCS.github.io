      <p class="well lead">The Department is located in the one of the newest building on campus, the Walsh Science Center, and provides students with up-to-date labs and equipment, which they use to work on many projects. Some of these projects include graphics and animation, web application development, robot-human interaction, user interface design, and large-scale distributed computing.<br><br>

      Program graduates are well prepared to master the ever-changing technology in the computer industry. Graduates readily find entry level IT and software development positions and alumni working in the industry frequently recruit new graduates, resulting in clusters of Bonaventure CS alumni at several companies.</p>
