This lab involves writing and testing various <i>methods</i>.&nbsp; The methods will be documented using Javadoc comments.&nbsp; All the methods will be written as <i>static</i> methods.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">
This lab is based on material in Section 4.4 (<i>The Anatomy of a Method</i>) 
from the textbook. <br>

<ol>
<li>
Launch the Eclipse development environment and create a new project named 
Lab 8.&nbsp; Place a copy of <a href="Fun.java">Fun.java</a> into the src folder of the project.&nbsp; 
(Either download the file to the Desktop and then copy it into Eclipse or copy 
it from the file server.)&nbsp; Then also create a new file FunctionTester.java 
(with a main method) that you will use to verify that the various functions in 
this lab work correctly.<br><br>
Examine
the Fun class.&nbsp; How many methods does it contain?&nbsp; For each method, 
give its signature and show a &quot;sample call&quot; to that method.
</li><br><br>

<li>
Add statements to the main method in FunctionTester to test the 
<span class="style4">sumOfFactors()</span> method in 
the Fun class.&nbsp; Your statements should include both a description of the 
input and the output so that it is obvious from reading the statement that the 
answer is correct. <em>Use at least three cases to test your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> 
Print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>

<li>
Add statements to the main method in FunctionTester to test the
<span class="style4">passFail()</span> method in 
the Fun class.&nbsp; (You may replace the statements from Step 2.)&nbsp; Your statements should include both a description of the 
input and the output so that it is obvious from reading the statement that the 
answer is correct. <em>Use at least three cases to test your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> 
Print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>

<li>
Write a static method that calculates the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n.&nbsp; Add 
Javadoc comments to the method.&nbsp; Write statements in the main method to test 
this method.&nbsp; (In this step, and each of the following steps, you may 
replace the statements from the previous step.)&nbsp; <em>Use at least three cases to test your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> and 
<span class="style3">print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>


<li>
Write a static method that finds the largest of five numbers.&nbsp; Add Javadoc 
comments to the method.&nbsp; Write statements in the main method to test this 
method.&nbsp; <em>Use at least three cases to test your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> and 
<span class="style3">print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>

<li>Write a static method that converts an integer to a month name, e.g., 1 
--&gt; January.&nbsp; Add Javadoc comments to the method.&nbsp; Write statements in 
the main method to test this method. <em>&nbsp;Use at least three cases to test 
your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> and 
<span class="style3">print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>

<li>Write a static method that finds the number of e's in a string.&nbsp; Add 
Javadoc comments to the method.&nbsp; Write statements in the main method to 
test this method.&nbsp; <em>Use at least three cases to test your method.</em><br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> and 
<span class="style3">print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>

<li>Write a static method that <em>uses a loop</em> to sum the first k<em> 
odd</em> integers.&nbsp; (Thus, if k=4, the sum is: 1+3+5+7.)<em>&nbsp; </em>Add Javadoc comments to the method.&nbsp; Write statements in 
the main method to test this method.<br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> and 
<span class="style3">print the statements 
used to test the method</span> and turn these in as part of your lab.
</li><br><br>
</ol>

<p class="Question"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Extra Credit:&nbsp; (two points)</b>&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Rewrite the static method from Step 8 so that it does not use a loop!&nbsp; 
(This should result in a much shorter method!).&nbsp; Also, present a clear and 
convincing argument that your new method always returns the same answer as the 
one in Step 8.<br>
<br>
Run the program that tests the method.&nbsp; Print the output from the test.&nbsp;<span class="style3"> Print the method (including the comments)</span> 
and turn these in as part of your lab.&nbsp; (You can skip the testing 
statements; I should have them from Step 8!)</span></p>
